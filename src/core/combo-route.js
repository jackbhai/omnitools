/**
 * combo-route.js — one graph, two modes, and an answer that is a *journey*.
 *
 * The combined planner used to bolt a feeder bus onto a metro plan when one
 * happened to exist, and otherwise print "Metro: 26 min" next to "Bus: 58 min"
 * and leave the choice to the reader. That is not a combined planner: it never
 * looked for the bus that beats the metro by ₹28, or the one that drops you at a
 * station two stops earlier.
 *
 * So this builds one graph out of the two published datasets and searches it.
 *
 *   node  b#<stop index>     one of the physical bus stops in bus-delhi.json
 *   node  m#<station name>   one of the metro stations in metro-delhi.json — a station
 *                            served by three lines is ONE node, so a change of line is
 *                            a costed event at that node and not a mystery detour
 *   edge  bus hop            consecutive stops of a published direction. km comes from that
 *                            route's own shape via journeyKm(), minutes from its own average
 *                            speed (published km ÷ published minutes) — the same two calls
 *                            the bus planner makes, so a leg measured here IS the leg the
 *                            bus tool prints, not an estimate of it
 *   edge  metro hop          consecutive stations of a line, haversine km at 0.55 km/min
 *   edge  walk               a station's published `b` list (the bus stops near it with
 *                            metres the scraper measured) and the documented foot transfers.
 *                            No invented corridors: where the data does not say two places
 *                            can be walked, this graph has no edge between them
 *
 * Costs, and their sources: a metro chain costs Σkm/0.55 + (runs−1)×CHANGE_MIN + ACCESS_MIN,
 * which is the metro planner's own headline formula, so the two tools cannot drift. A bus
 * ride costs its km ÷ its route's speed. A change of vehicle costs BOARD_MIN (getting off,
 * walking, getting on) and — importantly — that penalty is charged even when the rider walks
 * between the two platforms, because walking around a transfer does not make it free.
 * Fares are the slabs: DMRC once per continuous metro chain, DTC per bus ride (no free
 * transfer is modelled because DTC publishes none in this dataset), and a chain that includes
 * a line outside DMRC is flagged `separateTicket` instead of being quietly priced.
 *
 * "Best" is a person's business, so the same graph is searched by minutes and by rupees, and
 * the panel ranks the union by `value` = minutes + ₹/VOT_RPM (VOT_RPM is stated in the UI,
 * not hidden in the code). Journeys that walk more than MAX_WALK_MIN, or that are slower AND
 * dearer than another journey found, are dropped — and `dropped` says how many, so the panel
 * can say it out loud instead of pretending there was nothing to choose from.
